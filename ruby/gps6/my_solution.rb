# EXPLANATION OF require_relative: Makes a link to a second related Ruby file and virtually imports the file,
# require takes the full file path as opposed to equire_relative which takes a file in same folder.

#The difference between the hashes is that in one the key is presented with the Rocket symbol and the other with the colon as a symbol.

#Using each methods.

#Instance variables are not supposed to be used as a parameter or argument, ever.

#class attributes

#The STATE_DATA variable is a constant and its scope is anywhere in the file.
