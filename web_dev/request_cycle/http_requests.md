What are some common HTTP status codes?
There are many different status codes, and they are organized by their function depending on its first number:
1xx Informational responses
2xx Confirming success of action requested
3xx Redirecting (client must take additional action)
4xx Error (Client)
5xx Error (Server)


What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?
GET only requests information, while POST is used to add or update remote data.

Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?
A cookie is a piece of data sent from the server and stored on the client's computer on the web browser that runs while a website is running.
