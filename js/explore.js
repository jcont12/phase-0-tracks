
//1.- Create a function on javascript with a parameter (word to reverse)
//2.- The word we want to reverse should be put into a variable so we can call its index (word[i])
//3.- Get the length of the word, and print each letter from last to first using index and add them

function reverse(word) {
	var index = word.length
	console.log(index)
	console.log(word[0])
}

reverse("Jorge")
