   The purpose of semantic tags is to organize your webpage into different sections and give you a clearer perspective on where content is going to be. I personally find Nav very useful since almost all web pages have a navigator menu now. I also like aside because I think it forces me to think of more relevant and indirect information I can add on the webpage. I think the order in which the browser displays my information is from top to bottom of my html page, unless a specific semantic tag such as header and footer are used.
I have liked sublime and the snippet tool is very helpful!! I will definitely create more snippets to help me out.
I think the concept that I found the most difficult is the article tag, I just keep having trouble understanding its specific use, I'll try looking at youtube videos to understand it better.
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
